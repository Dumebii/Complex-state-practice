# Problem 
Managing complex state in React

## Objective 
To create a HTML form with three input tags, and have the values being entetered intot the input tags display on the screen as they are typed. 

## Learning Curve
In this project, I learnt all about updating complex state, without writing out multiple functions, and making use of objects, and object destructuring. 

I also learnt about the spread operator, and how we can use it to breakdown objects, strings and arrays. 


### About
This is a practice project from Angela Yu's web development bootcamp.
